# Factory Fuzion - Industrial Intelligence Platform
Factory Fuzion provides managed industrial networks, Zero-Trust OT security, and Unified Fabric architecture to eliminate unplanned downtime on the plant floor.

## Core Problem
The cost of complexity on the plant floor. Unplanned downtime costs large-scale manufacturing an average of $22,000 per minute. Traditional IT networks are too slow, too blind, and require skills that controls engineers don't have. Competitor "Bolt-On" security tools are read-only and require expensive hardware.

## The Factory Fuzion Fix
Security and visibility run natively inside the industrial switch fabric (Edge Processing). Zero extra hardware, active policy enforcement, and instant threat isolation.

## Platform Features
1. Operations (OT): Plug & Play onboarding, AI-enabled monitoring in plain-English, IIoT ready (60W PoE), CIP Safety Jitter Guarantees, SD Card Swap-and-Boot recovery, and "Sidecar" NEMA enclosures.
2. IT & Security: Global Threat Intelligence, SOC/SIEM Integration, Identity-First Security (Entra ID/MFA), Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) for malware/ghost traffic, and CVE Vulnerability Management.
3. Executive ROI: Solves the OT skills crisis, eliminates CapEx shock, protects cyber insurance premiums, standardizes M&A infrastructure, creates a Unified Backbone for MES/ERP, and protects OEE (no automated production shutdowns without human approval).

## Service Tiers
- Tier 1 (Foundation): Visibility & Infrastructure bedrock.
- Tier 2 (Compliance): Active Security, DPI, and Audit logging.
- Tier 3 (Convergence): Unified Fabric (Core, Distribution, Office) + Fractional OT-CIO + Remote Access.
